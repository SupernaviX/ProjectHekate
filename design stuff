Limitations
===========
- Bullets cannot hold any extra data
- Emitters cannot hold any extra data

How will bullets be handled?
============================
- Virtual machine holds an array of state-per-bullet, i.e. code, current state
- Virtual machine "updates" the bullets
i.e.
virtualMachine.Update(i);

Virtual machine stores all the functions, bullet updaters, emitter updaters. How does it store them?
Dictionaries of strings to CodeBlocks (maybe specific ones for each type of different block?)

What is a CodeBlock?

Quite literally, a List<uint> (a block of code).

class CodeBlock
{
    List<uint> Code { get; set; }

    list of numerical variables
    list of emitter variables
    internal reference to VM (so that it can access the list of emitter properties)

}

where are variable values stored? in the ScriptState class

class VirtualMachine .. in code

class ScriptState .. in code

Functions can only call:
- other functions
Functions CANNOT USE THE WAIT STATEMENT! They may or may not return a value.

Emitter updaters can only call:
- functions

Bullet updaters can only call:
- functions
